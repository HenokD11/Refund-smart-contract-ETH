Introduction

    A program or application stored and run on the blockchain network is referred to as a decentralized application (dApp).

The refund by location smart contract is aimed to be used when one party, for example, an employer, agrees to pay another party, for example, an employee, for being present in a certain geographic area for a certain duration. The employee's phone sends its GPS location to a smart contract at a certain interval. Based on the pre-agreed contract codified in an Ethereum smart contract, a cryptocurrency payment is executed when all the agreed conditions are met.

If at any point, the GPS sensor indicates that an employee is outside the range of the agreed GPS area, the contract state will be updated to indicate that it is out of compliance.

Ethereum has two types of accounts:

        Externally Owned Accounts (EOA): These accounts are used by nodes to send or receive Ether. These accounts are associated with a private key.
        Contract Accounts: These accounts hold and execute smart contract code. Unlike EOAs, contract accounts do not have a private key.

Requirements

The project requires the following: Node.JS
